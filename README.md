Challenge: Develop a technical analysis-based model using machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict the forthcoming trend of the stock market.

Problem Statement: Predicting stock market trends is a challenging task for data scientists due to the complex and non-linear nature of the stock market. The stock market is easily affected by various parameters such as stock-specific news, global economy, and public sentiment, making it difficult to predict with a high level of accuracy.

Solution: In this hackathon, we propose to develop a technical analysis-based model using machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict the stock market trend in the short term. The proposed model uses four different candlestick patterns with a timeframe of one day for prediction, which are widely used in technical analysis and have been found to be highly correlated with the stock market trend.

Experimental Results: Our proposed model has been tested and achieved an accuracy of 66% in predicting the forthcoming trend of the stock market using four different candlestick patterns. The model can be used in short-term investments to obtain a considerable rate of interest. Additionally, the model can contribute to the development of more accurate and reliable methods for predicting stock market trends.

Conclusion: We believe that the proposed model can provide a significant contribution to the fintech industry by providing a reliable method for predicting stock market trends. The model has the potential to be enhanced by incorporating additional features and techniques, leading to improved accuracy and performance.
